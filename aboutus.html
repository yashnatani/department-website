        <h2>Historical Review</h2>
            <p>The history of Electrical Engineering at Engineering College Kota can be traced along technical and professorial lines with its birth through the legislative procedures of the state government of Rajasthan, affiliation for the courses through University of Rajasthan and  recognition as a premier institute for technical education in the state of Rajasthan by the A.I.C.T.E., with the arrival of the first Professor of Electrical Engineering  Dr. B. L. Mathur at Engineering College Kota, its extension to pow-er transmission with the arrival of Dr. D.K.Parihar in 1980, and its significant expansion into electronics and radio communi-cations with the arrival of Dr. M. L. Gupta. The rest, as they say, is history. This short narrative expands on the story of the Department of Electrical Engineering in the context of the College of Engineering, from its inception .</p>
            
            <p>Engineering has always been an important subject at Engineering College Kota. The department of Electrical Engineering sa-w many land marks in the form of expansion to the branches of Electronics and communication, Electronics and Instrumenta-tion, Computer Science and Information Technology under its aegis. The department of electrical engineering also runs Ful-l time postgraduate courses in “Power System” and "Power Electronics and Electric Drives" Engineering.  The department has recently been split in to three departments for the convenience of administrative handling and better teacher student interaction.</p>
